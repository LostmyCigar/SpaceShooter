# SpaceShooter
 
Due to me working onaa fulltime project I choose to not use ECS and instead only tried some optimizations using jobs and the burst compiler.

# Implementation
//reminder to update this

# Notes

Full Naive implementation 
(IS OOP)

This includes pooling on bullets. With pooling the total bullets can't go over 30 due to destruction time and firerate. 

Iâ€™ll mainly try optimizing the game with the use of enemies (asteroids).

Only spawning at start:

Enemy size: 88b

5 asteroids: ~185fps
50 asteroids: ~180fps

500 asteroids:

 FPS ~140

GC alloc: 0.7mb

Spawning takes 146ms

5000 asteroids: ~30fps

50000 asteroids: ~0.9fps

 Comparison 5000 to 50000 enemies in memory

Scared of whatever this is:

Spawning with set intervals:

50 enemies every second:
(Around 100 enemies active at any time)

Fun little spike on one single enemy. (Why?)

With Enemies Pooled:

Cant say i understand why pooling doesnt seem to have an impact unless im doing something wrong when releasing pooled enemies (Setting them inactive). But the allocation seems to be happening OnTriggerEnter. 


Update: 

Me being somewhat unfamiliar to the profiler have been profiling the editor so far and not standalone builds. This makes a lot of my comparisons so far useless since a big portion of GC allocation has been done by the editor it seems.


I have these odd spikes when running the standalone build:

With pooling so far all the GC aloc that is happening comes from coroutine calls

Using jobs and burst compiler:


Spawning 500 enemies every second
